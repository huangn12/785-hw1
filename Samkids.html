		<h2>Brief of Samkids</h2><br>
		SamKids is looking to provide children with the opportunity to find their deepest interests and passions, and reveal and unlock their untapped potential in various areas of of their personal and social life, by creating an innovative child-based assessment package.
		Although creating an assessment package is our overall goal, we must first proceed with three other specific goals in order to progress effectively. These three goals are to create and formulate questions, a website, and an assessment database (in that order). Although the database is the most important in terms of sustaining the website, we must be able to have meaningful and purposeful questions that are simple for children and their response options be measurable for this comprehensive assessment. This will be done by subjects and be created not only by our group members, but by professionals with expertise in various fields to ensure everything has a specified formula. This is important to specify, as creating simple questions is easy, but formulating simple questions that contribute to the awareness of childrenâ€™s talents is challenging but incredibly valuable.
